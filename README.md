## Description
This addon will allow pawns becoming depraved or cannibals. This will happen when pawn will participate in some actions like executing prisoners, or eating lot of human flesh.

## Depraved trait
New trait that works similar to psychopath. Depraved pawns will be only concerned about colony(or faction) members, in contrast to Psychopath trait that affects more social actions.
Depraved trait will appear naturally with commonality equal for example to Kind trait.
Mechanics of gaining/loosing this trait is a bit complex, but it will generally give Depraved trait to pawns that are witnessing violence and life crisis, and will remove from pawns that are living in moral community.
Executing, selling prisoners and harvesting organs will contribute to becoming depraved.
Releasing prisoners, rescuing strangers, and gaining friends will contribute to becoming moral again.
* [List of actions affected by this mechanics](../../wiki/Depraved-trait)
* [Depraved progression explanation](../../wiki/Morality-progression)

## Cannibal trait
When pawn will be forced to eat human meat, there will be chance that he will become cannibal. The more pawn eat human flesh, the greater chance of becoming cannibal. 
* [Cannibalism progression explanation](../../wiki/Cannibalism-progression)

## Compatibility
* You can enable this mod to old saves.
* You **can't** disable this mod from saves **yet**. I will prepare soon manual solution that will consist running script or editing save file manually.
